# R-codes-for-assignments-and-homeworks


Hello there visitor.

* This is my repository for all the assignments and homeworks submitted towards my degree "Business Analytics" from University of Cincinnati for the academic session 2017 - 18. But this doesn't contain all of them as some got lost here and there. 

* The different submssions have been put under folders for different subjects.

* All the submission codes are written in R. 

* This repository is most useful for someone who wants to evaluate my way/style of writing codes for a recruitment.

* If that is the case, I would also kindly request you to check my other folders, where I will be adding codes for some of my pet projects
