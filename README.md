# R-codes


Hello there visitor.

* This is my repository for all the work I have coded in R (upcoming Python) in last 1 year. It includes assignment submissions for different courses I have undertaken towards my degree "Master of Science - Business Analytics"

* This repository is most useful for a recruiter who wants to evaluate my way/style of writing codes 

* You would also like to checkout my Rpubs profile: https://rpubs.com/vermaph & Tableau public profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/piyush.verma#!/

* Very soon, I will be adding codes for some of my pet projects 

Have a great day !!
