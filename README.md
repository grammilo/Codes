# R-codes-for-assignments-and-homeworks


Hello there visitor.

*This is my repository for all the assignment and homeworks which I have doen towards my degree "Business Analytics" from University of Cincinnati
for the academic session 2017 - 18. But this doesn't contain all of them as some got lost here and there. 

*The different submssions have been put under folders for different subjects.

*All the submission codes are here written in R. 

*This repository is most useful for someone who wants to evaluate my way/style of writing codes for a recruitment.

*If that is the case, I would also kindly request you to check my other folders, where soon I will adding codes to more of my pet projects.
