# R-codes


Hello there visitor.


* This is my repository for some of the work I have been doing since August 2017

* Check out my pet projects folder (more projects coming up...)

* This repository is most useful for a recruiter who wants to evaluate my way/style of writing codes 

* You would also like to checkout my Rpubs profile: https://rpubs.com/vermaph & Tableau public profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/piyush.verma#!/

* If you like my work, a word of appreciation will make my day and critical suggestions will help me move forward. Send both of them to: piyushverma.iitkgp@gmail.com

Have a great day !!
