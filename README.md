# R-codes


Hello there visitor.

* This is my repository for all the assignments and homeworks submitted towards my degree "Business Analytics" from University of Cincinnati for the academic session 2017 - 18. This is still a work in progress and also doesn't contain all of them as some got lost here and there

* The different submssions have been put under folders for different subjects

* All the submission codes are written in R

* This repository is most useful for someone who wants to evaluate my way/style of writing codes for a recruitment

* Very soon, I will adding codes for few more of my pet projects
