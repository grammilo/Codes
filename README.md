# Hello.

This is repository where I have been adding and updating my latest pet projects. The purpose of this space is to showcase potential recruiters my analytical skillsets. 

Some of the interesting project I have completed so far are:

  1. Building a R Shiny appliction to predict the next word when a user enters a string of words
  2. Customer Segmentation for a retail supermarket using R
